# Collaboration: skill dependencies and composition

name: claude-md
version: "1.0.0"

dependencies:
  - skill: docs-refresh
    direction: outbound
    required: false
    reason: "After editing CLAUDE.md, docs-refresh may need to update the skills table"

composition:
  - when: "Editing CLAUDE.md content (outside auto-generated markers)"
    sequence:
      - claude-md
      - docs-refresh  # only if skills table affected

  - when: "Restructuring CLAUDE.md"
    sequence:
      - claude-md

triggers:
  - pattern: "edit CLAUDE.md|update CLAUDE.md|restructure CLAUDE.md|CLAUDE.md too long"
    suggest: claude-md
  - condition: "CLAUDE.md being edited or restructured"
    action: "Follow claude-md patterns for content quality"

complements:
  - skill: docs-refresh
    relationship: "Sibling — both work on CLAUDE.md, different sections. claude-md owns content outside markers; docs-refresh owns the skills table between markers."
  - skill: create-skill
    relationship: "After creating a skill, docs-refresh updates the table; claude-md ensures surrounding content stays clean"

boundaries:
  owns:
    - "CLAUDE.md content quality, style, and structure"
    - "CLAUDE.md sections outside auto-generated markers"
    - "Line budget and relevance enforcement"
  defers_to:
    - "Skills table between markers -> docs-refresh"
    - "REFERENCE.md generation -> docs-refresh"
    - "Committing changes -> commit"
  extension_points:
    - "Additional lint checks can be added to lint-claude-md.sh"
